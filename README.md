# todolist

I've taken a 1month React Codes Challenge. This is my second project of #oneMonthWithReact. This is an enhanced todoList project, I mean, I followed a internet codebase, then improved on three places.

########## What I did: ########## 
# Created a todo List project
# You can add your task here
# You can delete any of your task
# Task you added last, goes to the last place of the list

########## What I enhanced? ##########
1. Can't create a task if no input is given!
2. Inline functions instead of too many callback functions. Thus Codebase looks light.
3. Button alert window, setState use.
